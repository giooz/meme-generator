## Description

Project developed along the "Learn React" webcourse at Scrimba.com, creating a Meme Generator webpage.

In this project, I learned how to use the useState and useEffect Hooks, as well as how to manipulate Forms in ReactJS. 

I also studied the conditional rendering of components and their interaction with event listeners.

Local project created using Vite.
